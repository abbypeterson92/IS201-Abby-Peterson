                                <p>I was born and raised in Utah with an amazing mom and dad and two little brothers, Andrew and Ben. When I was 13, my mom passed away from a rare form 
                                    of cancer. This lifechanging event was pivitol for me becoming who I am today. Grief was very hard on me and I struggled a lot with anxiety and depression. 
                                    But through it all, my family was there. They have been my rock. A year and a half after my mom died, my dad was remarried to my amazing step mother, Melia. 
                                    It was very hard at first to have someone new in our family after having become extremely close with my family throughout my life and after my mom passed.
                                    But she is a rock in our family and I couldn't have asked for a better step mom. My dad and my step mom had twin boys who are now almost 3 years old. They 
                                    are the life of the party at our house! They keep us busy, but they brough our family together like nothing else could. They are the cutest!
                                    
                                </p>
                                <p class="mb-0">
                                    Our now family of 7 has so much fun together. We enjoy watching movies, going on trips, and chasing two little boys around together. 
                                    Our family is having a lot of change this summer! My brother Andrew who is 18 is leaving on his mission to Houston, Texas and I am getting married in July!
